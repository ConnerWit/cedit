# Cedit is a small code editor written in C.

This project is still a W.I.P. (for a long time lol). But I'm getting there, trust me.

## Setting up

After cloning, simply type 'make' in the root directory to compile and run the project.

(I'll probably be the only one setting this up but it's a good note to use for myself ðŸ˜‰)
