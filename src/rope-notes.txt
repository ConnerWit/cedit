rope + gap buffer core functions

rope structure:
    initalize rope
    split the rope at index
    concatenate rope (with proper rebalancing)
    get total rope length

gap buffer:
    insert text inside leaf node
    delete text inside leaf node
    gap movement based on cursor
    expand gap when it gets too small

hybrid operations:
    route operations to leaf vs rope level
    trigger specific rope operations when leaf gets too big
    update weights after modifications
    marking nodes 'dirty' for lazy recalculations
