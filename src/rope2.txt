This is a note block for my next prototype (mad scientist laugh)

ROPE + GAP BUFFER CORE FUNCTIONS

ROPE STRUCTURE:
ropeInit() - intialize rope
ropeFree() - deallocate rope
ropeSplit() - split at index
ropeConcat() - join two ropes  
ropeRebalance() - AVL rebalancing
ropeSearch() - search index

HYBRID OPERATIONS:
ropeInsert() - route insert to leaf/split
ropeDelete() - route delete to leaf/split  
ropeGetChar() - navigate tree for character
ropeLength() - cached total length

GAP BUFFER LEAF:
leafInsert() - insert text at gap
leafDelete() - delete range
leafMoveGap() - relocate gap to cursor
leafGetChar() - get character at index

OPTIMIZATION:
ropeMarkDirty() - flag modified nodes
ropeUpdateWeights() - recalc dirty weights only
ropeShouldSplit() - check leaf size threshold
